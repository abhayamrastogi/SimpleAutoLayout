# SimpleAutoLayout
Simple utility app for iOS Auto Layout 

Auto Layout is a powerful and flexible way of organising and laying out your views. However creating constraints from code is verbose and not very descriptive. SimpleAutoLayout provides a fully capable and developer-friendly interface for Auto Layout. It is designed for clarity and simplicity, and takes inspiration from the AutoLayout UI options available in Interface Builder while delivering far more flexibility.

There is a very basic single Utility file containing constraints. You can add more complex constraints to make your code simple and user friendly.
